Unit II - MongoDB Setup and Intro to MERN (node api)
Create a MongoDB collection representing a team of players for a sport. This could be made up data or data based on a real team for a sport of your choosing--a Cricket team for instance. Once you have created your collection, create and demonstrate 5 queries that would be appropriate for your collection.

Unit 4 - Creating a Frontend (bible-verse-app)
Following the guides linked above, create a simple front-end application using Node and React + Vite. The application should make a call to this public API: https://labs.bible.org/api_web_service, and request for a random verse from the Bible every time that a button is clicked. Make an additional component which calls the API to GET a specific verse from the Bible (eg. John 3:16). This application should look appealing, but still simple: don't overdo it with the styling, just make sure it is functional.
